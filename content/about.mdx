## Quick Introduction

In my free time I like to go swimming, play badminton, rage at video games, sleep, and cook food. My interests lie in both hardware and software, with a passion for video games, game development, AI, media production and transportation. I am always hungry to tackle new challenges and new opportunities.
    Here's a little more about my personal self.
