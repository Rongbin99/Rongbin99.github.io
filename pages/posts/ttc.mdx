Having been taking the TTC since 2010 when I was a little kid going to school, I want to share some of my memories and thoughts of the good ol' days.

## The TTC in the 2010s
The TTC in the 2010s had a vastly different appearance than it does today (as of writing this post). Mostly all of the busses, streetcars, and subways have been replaced by newer models with only some still operational as they quickly reach their end of operational lifespan (again, as of writing this post).

### T1, H-4, H-5, H-6 Series Subways on Line 2

[![T1 Exterior](/TTC/T1_EX.jpg)](https://ca.pinterest.com/pin/1128996200321769639/)
Before the T1's took over Line 2, Line 2 was serviced by a combination of [T1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_series_(Toronto_subway)), [H-6, H-5,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H_series_(Toronto_subway)) and the older [H-4 series](https://transittoronto.ca/subway/5503.shtml) subways. All manufactured in Thunder Bay, Ontario, by [Bombardier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombardier_Transportation), and stored in [TTC Greenwood Yard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwood_Yard), these models made up my early childhood.

The H-4's featured cushioned seats, which wouldn't ache your butt, but they had an ancient look. The H-5/6's had orange doors and were similar to the T1's. The T1's had pink/magenta doors which were wider. All three looked basically identical from the outside, especially from the front as it would enter the subway platform.

I would call the T1's the "pink door subway," the H-5/6's as the "orange door subway" and the H-4's as the "cushion subway" with beige doors. One day on my trip to school, I noticed that I hadn't seen a beige doored cushioned (H-4) subway in a while, that's when it dawned on me that I might never see them again. Shortly after, the oranged doored (H-5/6) subways started to disappear and only the pink doored (T1) subways remained. 

[![Arrival of the Toronto Rocket](/TTC/TR_Arrive.jpg)](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/30610472447168325/)
In 2011, the arrival of the new [Toronto Rocket subways](#line-1-toronto-rocket-subways) began service on Line 1 leading to the retirement of the H-4 models on Line 2 due to the surplus of T1 subways being replaced by the TR subway on Line 1. Shortly after, the H-5 models saw the same faith, and eventually so did the H-6 in 2014. The T1's will eventually undergo the same event, however, due to the delay of upgrading Line 2 to ATC [(Automatic Train Control)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signalling_of_the_Toronto_subway) the T1's are being operated well pass their expected timeframe, with their EOS (End of Service) soon approaching for 2026 with the TTC planning to extend their operational lifetime by another 10 years.

### Line 1 Toronto Rocket Subways

The [Toronto Rocket subways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Rocket) were a new and modern addition to the subway fleet.

## Random History of the TTC
Before I go into some random history of the TTC, I **highly** suggest you to go watch these two videos by [notsmoothsteve](https://www.youtube.com/@notsmoothsteve) and [RM Transit by Reece Martin](https://www.youtube.com/@RMTransit):
- [Toronto Gauge: The TTC's Unique Distance Between Rails](https://youtu.be/1ExvoGODNn8) (history lesson on Toronto's unique streetcar tracks)
- [Why Toronto Removed a Subway Line and Why It’ll Be Okay (Eventually)](https://youtu.be/KvwmiSU7zLY) (history of Toronto's unique SRT line)

#### Line 2 Extentions East

#### Line 1 Extentions North

#### Subway Crash on Line 1

#### The 116E (Express)

## Random Stuff about the TTC
- Spadina Station connects to both Line 1 and Line 2 via a walkway corridor. There used to be a moving walkway in this corridor, however, it has since been removed and markings of the walkway can be found. For more information, I suggest checking out [notsmoothsteve's video on "The Two Spadina Stations"](https://youtu.be/vq11033vrcc).
- Underneath Bay Station lies an unused subway platform known as Yorkville. This unused platform is used to host events, film videos, and many other things!
- Before the [Express Bus Network](https://stevemunro.ca/2018/07/25/ttc-launches-the-900-express-bus-network/) was established in 2018, which utilises the 900 series bus routes, the express network included the "Rocket network," with bus routes utilising a form of 19X (where X is a integer from 0 to 9 - [ex// 198 UofT Scarborough Rocket](https://transittoronto.ca/bus/routes/198-uoft-scarbo.shtml)), and a E or Express variant of the local route such as the 86E, [116E*](#the-116e-express), 54E, 95E, etc.
