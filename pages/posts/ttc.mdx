Having been taking the TTC since 2010 when I was a little kid going to school, I want to share some of my memories and thoughts of the good ol' days.

  <em>TTC Greenwood Yard in 1995</em>
</div>

The TTC in the 2010s had a vastly different appearance than it does today (as of writing this post). Mostly all of the busses, streetcars, and subways have been replaced by newer models with only some still operational as they quickly reach their end of operational lifespan (again, as of writing this post).

  <em>T1 Subway Leaving Chester Station on Line 2 Headed Westbound</em>
</div>

Before the T1's took over Line 2: Bloor-Danforth, Line 2 was serviced by a combination of [T1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_series_(Toronto_subway)), [H-6, H-5,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H_series_(Toronto_subway)) and the older [H-4 series](https://transittoronto.ca/subway/5503.shtml) subways. All manufactured in Thunder Bay, Ontario, by [Bombardier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombardier_Transportation), and stored in [TTC Greenwood Yard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwood_Yard), these models made up my early childhood.

  <em>H-4 Subway Interior Featuring Cushioned Seats</em>
</div>

The H-4's featured cushioned seats, which wouldn't ache your butt, but they did have an aging look. The H-5/6's had orange doors and were similar to the T1's. The T1's had pink/magenta doors which were wider. All three looked basically identical from the outside, especially from the front as they would enter the station. If you would like to see what it was like to ride on a H4 subway, [OrionVIII](https://www.youtube.com/@orionviii) has a video: [TTC H4 Ride from Bloor-Yonge to Old Mill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rxna_nbkug).

  <em>T1 Interior with Magenta Wide Doors and Removal of the Center Poles</em>
</div>

I would call the T1's the "pink door subway," the H-5/6's as the "orange door subway" and the H-4's as the "cushion subway" with beige doors. One day on my trip to school, I noticed that I hadn't seen a beige door cushioned (H-4) subway in a while, that's when it dawned on me that I might never see them again. Shortly after, the orange door (H-5/6) subways started to disappear and only the pink door (T1) subways remained.

  <em>New Toronto Rocket Subway Next to an Old T1 Model at [TTC Davisville Yard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davisville_Yard)</em>
</div>

In 2011, the arrival of the new [Toronto Rocket subways](#toronto-rocket-subways-on-line-1) began service on Line 1 leading to the retirement of the H-4 models on Line 2 due to the surplus of T1 subways being replaced by the TR subway on Line 1. Shortly after, the H-5 models saw the same faith, and eventually so did the H-6 in 2014. The T1's will eventually undergo the same event, however, due to the delay of upgrading Line 2 to ATC [(Automatic Train Control)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signalling_of_the_Toronto_subway) the T1's are being operated well pass their expected time frame, with their EOS (End of Service) soon approaching for 2026 with the TTC planning to extend their operational lifetime by another 10 years.

  <em>Out of Service Door on a T1</em>
</div>

One uncommon sight would be to see a red tart covering a door on the T1s. These would clip onto the hooks present at every door frame. This would happen when the door is unoperatable due to it being jammed or broken from people leaning against the door or forcing it open.

  <em>TR Subway Leaving Davisville Station Heading Northbound to [Sheppard West (formerly Downsview)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheppard_West_station)</em>
</div>

The [Toronto Rocket subways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Rocket) were a new and modern addition to the subway fleet and introduced in 2011. Not only did it bring a sleek interior with screens capable of indicating which side the platform doors would open [(for side and center platform stations)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Toronto_subway_stations), you were able to freely traverse throughout the cars of the subway, from front to back, without restriction of having to open a door unlike on the GO Train. This meant the TR had an "accordion" (as it looks like one from the outside) much like the [Flexity Outlook Streetcars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexity_Outlook_(Toronto)) / [Flexity Freedom LRTs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexity_Freedom) / Articulated Busses. This meant each TR car was serialized as they couldn't be separated, unlike the T1 and older models (and [Metrolinx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metrolinx) with their [notorious mix match of GO Train coaches](/TTC/GO_647.jpg)).

The TR made its first debut on [Line 1: Yonge-University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_1_Yonge%E2%80%93University) in 2011, eventually replacing all the T1s operating on that line. The excess T1s were moved onto [Line 2: Bloor-Danforth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_2_Bloor%E2%80%93Danforth) and stored in [Greenwood Yard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwood_Yard) to make storage space for the TRs in [Davisville Yard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davisville_Yard) and [Wilson Yard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilson_Yard). The TRs then made their way onto [Line 4: Sheppard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_4_Sheppard) in May 2016, relocating the existing T1s onto Line 2 to support the [aging T1 fleet](https://www.cp24.com/news/it-is-very-serious-ttc-ceo-concerned-as-subway-trains-on-line-2-approach-end-of-design-life-1.6934570) and maintain service.

While the [re-signalling of Line 2](https://www.ttc.ca/about-the-ttc/projects-and-plans/Major-Projects/Line-2-Automatic-Train-Control) from [Automatic Block Signalling (ABS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railway_signalling#Fixed_block) to [Automatic Train Control (ATC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_train_control) is underway, the current T1 subways servicing Line 2 are approaching their end of operational lifespan. The TTC is looking into [ordering new subways](https://toronto.ctvnews.ca/trudeau-says-new-toronto-subways-cars-an-ongoing-conversation-as-30b-federal-transit-fund-kicks-off-1.6966912) to replace the aging fleet. It is currently unsure if the TRs will move onto Line 2, or stay on Line 1 & 4 and have the newly ordered subways service Line 2. Greenwood Yard is also currently at capacity, and [Vincent (Keele) Yard](https://transittoronto.ca/subway/5303.shtml) is being retrofitted to increase capacity, however, we'll most likely have to wait until the new [Western Yard](https://www.ttc.ca/about-the-ttc/projects-and-plans/Major-Projects/Western-Yard-Train-Storage-and-Maintenance-Facility) gets completed.

  <em>S Series Scarborough RT Leaving Kennedy Station</em>
</div>

The [Line 3: Scarborough RT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_3_Scarborough) was a rapid transit line that exclusively served [Scarborough](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarborough,_Ontario), the eastern suburb of Toronto. Originally planned to be a streetcar route, utilizing the [CLRV & ALRV models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Light_Rail_Vehicle), the TTC swapped to a light metro after pressure from the provincial Ontario government to prototype the new [Intermediate Capacity Transit System (ICTS) Mark I trains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innovia_Metro) made by [Urban Transportation Development Corporation (UTDC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_Transportation_Development_Corporation), which at the time was owned by the Ontario Government and was later sold off to Bombardier. The TTC received 7 4-car ICTS Mark I trains, referenced as the [S series by the TTC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S_series_(Toronto_subway)). With construction having already begun with the anticipation of Line 3 being a streetcar route, a streetcar loop was already constructed at Kennedy station and has since been abandoned.

The SRT was never the smoothest or quietest. It was notorious for being loud around curves and would shake as it operated. Nonetheless, it connected the people of Scarborough from [Kennedy Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennedy_station), a major transportation hub, with [Scarborough Center Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarborough_Centre_station), another major transportation hub with TTC Bus and GO Bus connections, and the [Scarborough Town Center (STC) mall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarborough_Town_Centre).

The SRT was quickly reaching its end of service with the TTC extending it's operations by more than a decade. [Designed to only operate 25 years and to be decommissioned in 2010](https://www.cp24.com/news/the-scarborough-rt-was-supposed-to-be-replaced-years-ago-here-is-why-it-is-still-in-service-1.6493734), the TTC repaired and gave the aging trains a new blue vinyl decal in 2015, and rebuilt some in 2017, with hopes of [extending their service until 2026](https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/scarboroughs-creaking-srt-gets-a-makeover/article_c8bcba16-e6ac-512f-af3c-46ee6077288d.html) to eventually be replaced by the [subway extention of Line 2](https://toronto.citynews.ca/2023/01/17/scarborough-subway-extension-tunnelling/). Known as the [Scarborough Subway Extention](https://www.metrolinx.com/en/projects-and-programs/scarborough-subway-extension), it would expand subway service deep into Scarborough, giving Scarborough a direct connection with the rest of Toronto. Originally planned to be completed by 2026, it is now expected to be completed by 2030 (but who knows when it'll really open, afterall, [Line 5: Eglinton Crosstown LRT](#the-never-ending-completion-of-line-5) is still pending an opening date) and will service the areas that the SRT previously did.

Unfortuantely, [Rob Ford passed away from his fight against cancer in 2016](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/rob-ford-cancer-liposarcoma-1.3501477), and the Scarborough Subway extention (and plans for the SRT) was in limbo ever since. The TTC ultimately decided to decommission the SRT in November 2023, however, Line 3 was forced to close earlier than expected.

  <em>TTC SRT 3001 Derailed near [Ellesmere Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellesmere_station) on July 24, 2023</em>
</div>

On July 24, 2023, the last car of [SRT 3001 derailed](https://toronto.ctvnews.ca/ttc-head-confirms-cause-of-scarborough-rt-derailment-1.6578033) with 45 people on board, sending 5 to hospital with minor injuries, while travelling southbound towards Kennedy station after having just left Ellesmere station. The TTC ultimately decided to [permanently close the SRT following the derailment](https://toronto.ctvnews.ca/line-3-will-stay-closed-permanently-after-scarborough-rt-derailment-1.6532878), as the line was to be decomissioned shortly after anyways, and focused on accerlating the [service of replacement busses](https://stevemunro.ca/2023/09/26/line-3-srt-replacement-service-and-derailment-investigation/). 

Following the derailment, the [TTC re-routed basically every bus to go to Kennedy station and Scarborough Center station](https://toronto.citynews.ca/2023/11/14/ttc-line-3-scarborough-rt-buses-kennedy-midland-ellesmere/). This saw the re-introduction of the [903 Kennedy-Scarborough Centre Express](https://transittoronto.ca/bus/routes/903-kennedy-sca.shtml) (formerly the [131E Nugget Express](https://transittoronto.ca/bus/routes/131-nugget.shtml)). However, this also caused the [bus platforms at Kennedy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennedy_station#Surface_connections) to become unnecessairly confusing with Platform A servicing the original bus routes that serviced Kennedy, and Platform B exclusively being for the busses that went to Scarborough Center station. This only became more confusing when [half of Platform A was closed](https://transittoronto.ca/archives/weblog/2024/02/17-scarboroug.shtml), due to the Line 2 Scarborough Extention construction, and caused the bus platforms to be shuffled yet again (so many bus platform patch notes). Also, in my opinion, it makes no sense to make the [985 Sheppard East Express](https://transittoronto.ca/bus/routes/985-sheppard-ea.shtml) (formerly the [85E Sheppard East Express](https://transittoronto.ca/bus/routes/85-sheppard-eas.shtml) and [190 Scarborough Centre Rocket](https://transittoronto.ca/bus/routes/190-scarborough.shtml)) and [939 Finch Express](https://transittoronto.ca/bus/routes/939-finch-expre.shtml) (formerly the [199 Finch Rocket](https://transittoronto.ca/bus/routes/939-finch-expre.shtml)) divert their routes all the way south to Kennedy just to go back north to continue their original routes — it just adds so much unnecessary distance and time to their already long service routes.

With the Scarborough Subway underway, this extension of Line 2 brings potential for an [extension of Line 4 in the future](https://www.metrolinx.com/en/projects-and-programs/sheppard-extension). Although in its early stages of development (the extension plan, not the subway line — ok the line is also the newest), [Line 4: Sheppard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_4_Sheppard) is the shortest and least utilised subway line in the entire TTC, and extending it east (and west to [Sheppard West](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheppard_West_station) — but thats another story) to connect with Line 2 at Sheppard station (they'll have to rename one of the Sheppards lol) in Scarborough would drastically increase ridership as it provides a subway line for uptown Toronto (no more overcrowded [85 Sheppard East](https://transittoronto.ca/bus/routes/85-sheppard-eas.shtml), [95 York Mills](https://transittoronto.ca/bus/routes/95-york-mills.shtml), and [39 Finch East](https://transittoronto.ca/bus/routes/39-finch-east.shtml) busses — some of the busiest bus lines in the entire city). Perhaps the [Spanish platform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_solution) at Line 4 of [Sheppard-Yonge station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheppard%E2%80%93Yonge_station) will finally be put into use.

The interior of the CLRV and ALRV is pretty iconic. Sitting at the rear gave an amazing view above the cars and presented planty of seating. Unfortunately, since these streetcars were high floor, the stairs at the doors to get on and off posed a great barrier for accessibility. Also, the bells on these streetcars were so iconic.

This started with the introduction of the CLRV on the [507: Long Branch](https://transittoronto.ca/streetcar/4111.shtml) route and shortly after on the [510: Spadina](https://transittoronto.ca/streetcar/4108.shtml) route with a dedicated corridor.

The CLRVs used [trolley poles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_pole) to obtain their 600V DC power supply from the overhead wires. Thus, the new Flexity Outlooks came equipe with *both* trolley poles and [pantographs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantograph_(transport)) for them to be compatible with [Toronto's pre-existing infrastructure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_streetcar_system).

</div>

The TTC would gradually [convert the entire overhead wiring infrastructure](https://www.blogto.com/city/2018/05/ttc-rolling-out-new-type-streetcar-tech/) to support the more modern pantograph system as the new Flexity Outlooks draw more current compared to the CLRV/ALRV predecessors and the trolley poles only acted as a bottleneck to their full potential. When using trolley poles, the Flexity Outlooks would not have functioning air conditioning, reduced vehicle performance, and often [disconnects from the overhead wires](https://stevemunro.ca/2018/02/22/problems-with-trolley-shoes-on-flexity-cars/).

By November 2020, 80% of overhead infrastructure has been converted to being pantograph compatible with the entire system expected to be converted by 2025. This meant that for a period of time between 2014 to 2019, before the CLRVs were officially retired, not all routes were pantograph compatible. Not to mention, the CLRVs only supported trolley poles and were limited in operating the few routes that still supported them. This transition period required the TTC to carefully allocate their streetcar fleet.

  <em>TTC 4471 (Flexity Outlook) Streetcar: Before Flooding Incident on [510 Spadina](https://transittoronto.ca/streetcar/4108.shtml)</em>
</div>

Whenever a streetcar breaks down, as long as it hasn't derailed (like 4464 below), the streetcar gets towed by one of its fellow streetcars.

Much like trains, streetcars are able to chain together and allows for a working streetcar to tow the broken one to the maintenence yard.

Once a streetcar has derailed, it is a different story as the streetcar needs to be rerailed before it can be safely towed away, and rerailing a derailed streetcar is a long and complicated process.

</div>

Due to the majority of streetcar routes operating on streets without a dedicated streetcar corridor, streetcars tend to often be delayed as they get stuck in traffic attempting to share the roads with regular vehicles. This has been exagerbated by the fact that the Flexity Outlooks are longer than the previous CLRVs, taking up more road space from cars.

The [Orion VII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_VII) dominated the roads of Toronto in the 21st century with the TTC operating the largest fleet in North America. These diesel powered busses were reliable and had a similar internal layout to the present [Nova Bus LFS models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nova_Bus_LFS) that roam the streets (as of writing this). Built by [Orion Bus Industries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_Bus_Industries), these diesel demons were ordered in 2002 and hit the roads in 2003; being primairly assigned to the [Birchmount](https://transittoronto.ca/bus/8304.shtml) and [Eglinton](https://transittoronto.ca/bus/8311.shtml) bus garages.

The interior of the Orion VII is pretty standard and is unique because of the iconic raised seat at the rear. Due to the size of the [Detroit Diesel Series 50](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Diesel_Series_50) engine located at the rear, the Orion VII OG featured a high seat in the middle of the rear most row to accomodate the taller engine. Sitting in this seat was loads of fun and is nicknamed "The Orion Throne" from its elevated viewpoint. This seat is heavily missed 😭

  <em>Orion VII NG Interior: No Rear High Seat</em>

Unfortuantely, in 2013, Orion's parent company announced its [withdrawal from the market](https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/daimler-closing-ontario-bus-factory-that-supplies-ttc-1.1211175) and with the [aging bus fleet](https://transittoronto.ca/bus/8522.shtml) the TTC turned towards [Nova Bus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nova_Bus) for its next batch of bus orders. This is also the first time the TTC will be adding articulated busses into its fleet with the addition of the [Nova Bus LFS Arctic](https://cptdb.ca/wiki/index.php/Nova_Bus_LFS_Artic). The order for [Nova Bus LFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nova_Bus_LFS) and LFS Arctics were placed in 2013, with them hitting the roads in 2015 to slowly push the Orion VIIs into retirement in 2017. Nowandays, the rebuilt Orion VII OGs are only found in the Toronto's west-end along routes assigned to the [Mount Dennis bus garage](https://cptdb.ca/wiki/index.php/Toronto_Transit_Commission_Mount_Dennis_Division) ([14](https://transittoronto.ca/bus/routes/14-glencairn.shtml), [29](https://transittoronto.ca/bus/routes/29-dufferin.shtml), [35](https://transittoronto.ca/bus/routes/35-jane.shtml), etc.) with the Orion VII NGs still being found along the Scarborough routes assigned to [Malvern bus garage](https://transittoronto.ca/bus/8305.shtml) ([116](https://transittoronto.ca/bus/routes/116-morningside.shtml), [86](https://transittoronto.ca/bus/routes/86-scarborough.shtml), [38](https://transittoronto.ca/bus/routes/38-highland-cre.shtml), [95](https://transittoronto.ca/bus/routes/95-york-mills.shtml), etc.).

  <em>Spadina Station Entrance</em>
</div>

Spadina Station connects to both Line 1: Yonge-University and Line 2: Bloor-Danforth via a walkway corridor. There used to be a moving walkway in this corridor, however, it has since been removed and markings of the walkway can be found. For more information, I suggest checking out [notsmoothsteve's video on "The Two Spadina Stations"](https://youtu.be/vq11033vrcc).

  <em>The Abandoned Platform in Lower Bay Station</em>
</div>

Underneath Bay Station lies an unused subway platform known as [Yorkville or Lower Bay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_station#Lower_Bay). Lower Bay was only used for half a year before it was [decommissioned following a failed pilot project](https://justinpaulin.com/2016/07/07/a-peek-into-torontos-abandoned-bay-lower-subway-station/). This unused platform is now used to host events, film videos, and many other things!

Before the [Express Bus Network](https://stevemunro.ca/2018/07/25/ttc-launches-the-900-express-bus-network/) was established in 2018, which utilizes the 900 series bus routes, the express network included the "Rocket Network," with bus routes utilizing a form of 19X (where X is a integer from 0 to 9 - [ex// 198 UofT Scarborough Rocket](https://transittoronto.ca/bus/routes/198-uoft-scarbo.shtml)), and an E or Express variant of the local route such as the 86E ([986](https://transittoronto.ca/bus/routes/986-scarborough.shtml)), 116E (replaced by [198](https://transittoronto.ca/bus/routes/198-uoft-scarbo.shtml), and now [905](https://transittoronto.ca/bus/routes/905-eglinton-e.shtml)), 54E ([954](https://transittoronto.ca/bus/routes/954-lawrence-ea.shtml)), 95E ([995](https://transittoronto.ca/bus/routes/995-york-mills-.shtml)), etc.

### The Unique Toronto Gauge
The subways on Lines 1, 2, & 4 and streetcars all use the [unique Toronto gauge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto-gauge_railways) for their tracks. Toronto gauge is 4' 10 7⁄8" (1495mm) which is 60mm wider than standard gauge 4' 8 1⁄2" (1435mm). Thus, the CLRV, ALRV, Flexity Outlook, and Toronto subways are all unique to Toronto's rail system. Not only are the tracks different, but they also use a single point switch which would often get stuck, leading to streetcar operators to manually switch the rail.

The Flexity Freedom LRT used on [Line 5: Eglinton](#the-never-ending-completion-of-line-5) and [Line 6: Finch West](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_6_Finch_West) use standard gauge and is compatible with regular train tracks. The [Grand River Transit (GRT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_rapid_transit) ION uses the same Flexity Freedom LRT model as the Eglinton and Finch West LRTs, and the ION shares its tracks with [Canadian National (CN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_National_Railway) as CN sends a cargo train weekly to northern Waterloo to service the refineries.
