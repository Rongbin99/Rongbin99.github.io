Having been taking the TTC since 2010 when I was a little kid going to school, I want to share some of my memories and thoughts of the good ol' days.

## The TTC in the 2010s
The TTC in the 2010s had a vastly different appearance than it does today (as of writing this post). Mostly all of the busses, streetcars, and subways have been replaced by newer models with only some still operational as they quickly reach their end of operational lifespan (again, as of writing this post).

Before the T1's took over Line 2, Line 2 was serviced by a combination of [T1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_series_(Toronto_subway)), [H-6, H-5,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H_series_(Toronto_subway)) and the older [H-4 series](https://transittoronto.ca/subway/5503.shtml) subways. All manufactured in Thunder Bay, Ontario, by [Bombardier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombardier_Transportation), and stored in [TTC Greenwood Yard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwood_Yard), these models made up my early childhood.

  <em>H-4 Subway Interior Featuring Cushioned Seats</em>
</div>

The H-4's featured cushioned seats, which wouldn't ache your butt, but they did have an aging look. The H-5/6's had orange doors and were similar to the T1's. The T1's had pink/magenta doors which were wider. All three looked basically identical from the outside, especially from the front as they would enter the station.

  <em>T1 Interior with Magenta Wide Doors and Removal of the Center Poles</em>
</div>

I would call the T1's the "pink door subway," the H-5/6's as the "orange door subway" and the H-4's as the "cushion subway" with beige doors. One day on my trip to school, I noticed that I hadn't seen a beige door cushioned (H-4) subway in a while, that's when it dawned on me that I might never see them again. Shortly after, the orange door (H-5/6) subways started to disappear and only the pink door (T1) subways remained.

  <em>New Toronto Rocket Subway Next to an Old T1 Model at [TTC Davisville Yard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davisville_Yard)</em>
</div>

In 2011, the arrival of the new [Toronto Rocket subways](#line-1-toronto-rocket-subways) began service on Line 1 leading to the retirement of the H-4 models on Line 2 due to the surplus of T1 subways being replaced by the TR subway on Line 1. Shortly after, the H-5 models saw the same faith, and eventually so did the H-6 in 2014. The T1's will eventually undergo the same event, however, due to the delay of upgrading Line 2 to ATC [(Automatic Train Control)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signalling_of_the_Toronto_subway) the T1's are being operated well pass their expected time frame, with their EOS (End of Service) soon approaching for 2026 with the TTC planning to extend their operational lifetime by another 10 years.

  <em>Out of Service Door on a T1</em>
</div>

One uncommon sight would be to see a red tart covering a door on the T1s. These would clip onto the hooks present at every door frame. This would happen when the door is unoperatable due to it being jammed or broken from people leaning against the door or forcing it open.

</div>

The [Toronto Rocket subways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Rocket) were a new and modern addition to the subway fleet and introduced in 2011. Not only did it bring a sleek interior with screens capable of indicating which side the platform doors would open [(for side and center platform stations)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Toronto_subway_stations), you were able to freely traverse throughout the cars of the subway, from front to back, without restriction of having to open a door unlike on the GO Train. This meant the TR had an "accordion" (as it looks like one from the outside) much like the [Flexity Outlook Streetcars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexity_Outlook_(Toronto)) / [Flexity Freedom LRTs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexity_Freedom) / Articulated Busses. This meant each TR car was serialized as they couldn't be separated, unlike the T1 and older models (and [Metrolinx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metrolinx) with their [notorious mix match of GO Train coaches](/TTC/GO_647.jpg)).

The TR made its first debut on [Line 1: Yonge-University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_1_Yonge%E2%80%93University) in 2011, eventually replacing all the T1s operating on that line. The excess T1s were moved onto [Line 2: Bloor-Danforth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_2_Bloor%E2%80%93Danforth) and stored in [Greenwood Yard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwood_Yard) to make storage space for the TRs in [Davisville Yard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davisville_Yard) and [Wilson Yard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilson_Yard). The TRs then made their way onto [Line 4: Sheppard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_4_Sheppard) in May 2016, relocating the existing T1s onto Line 2 to support the [aging T1 fleet](https://www.cp24.com/news/it-is-very-serious-ttc-ceo-concerned-as-subway-trains-on-line-2-approach-end-of-design-life-1.6934570) and maintain service.

While the [re-signalling of Line 2](https://www.ttc.ca/about-the-ttc/projects-and-plans/Major-Projects/Line-2-Automatic-Train-Control) from [Automatic Block Signalling (ABS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railway_signalling#Fixed_block) to [Automatic Train Control (ATC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_train_control) is underway, the current T1 subways servicing Line 2 are approaching their end of operational lifespan. The TTC is looking into [ordering new subways](https://toronto.ctvnews.ca/trudeau-says-new-toronto-subways-cars-an-ongoing-conversation-as-30b-federal-transit-fund-kicks-off-1.6966912) to replace the aging fleet. It is currently unsure if the TRs will move onto Line 2, or stay on Line 1 & 4 and have the newly ordered subways service Line 2. Greenwood Yard is also currently at capacity, and [Vincent (Keele) Yard](https://transittoronto.ca/subway/5303.shtml) is being retrofitted to increase capacity, however, we'll most likely have to wait until the new [Western Yard](https://www.ttc.ca/about-the-ttc/projects-and-plans/Major-Projects/Western-Yard-Train-Storage-and-Maintenance-Facility) gets completed.

  <em>S Series Scarborough RT Leaving Kennedy Station</em>
</div>

The [Line 3: Scarborough RT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_3_Scarborough) is a light rapid transit line that exclusively served [Scarborough](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarborough,_Ontario), the eastern suburb of Toronto. Originally planned to be a streetcar route, utilizing the [CLRV & ALRV models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Light_Rail_Vehicle), the TTC swapped to a light metro after pressure from the provincial Ontario government to prototype the new [Intermediate Capacity Transit System (ICTS) Mark I trains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innovia_Metro) made by [Urban Transportation Development Corporation (UTDC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_Transportation_Development_Corporation), which at the time was owned by the Ontario Government and was later sold off to Bombardier. The TTC received 7 4-car ICTS Mark I trains, referenced as the [S series by the TTC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S_series_(Toronto_subway)). With construction having already begun with the anticipation of Line 3 being a streetcar route, a streetcar loop was already constructed at Kennedy station and has since been abandoned.

The SRT was never the smoothest or quietest. It was notorious for being loud around curves and shake as it operated. Nonetheless, it connected people of Scarborough from [Kennedy Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennedy_station), a major transportation hub, with [Scarborough Center Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarborough_Centre_station), another major transportation hub with TTC Bus and GO Bus connections, and the [Scarborough Town Center (STC) mall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarborough_Town_Centre).

### The Spadina Stations
*image of Spadina Stations*

Spadina Station connects to both Line 1 and Line 2 via a walkway corridor. There used to be a moving walkway in this corridor, however, it has since been removed and markings of the walkway can be found. For more information, I suggest checking out [notsmoothsteve's video on "The Two Spadina Stations"](https://youtu.be/vq11033vrcc).

Lower Bay was only used for half a year before it was [decommissioned following a failed pilot project](https://justinpaulin.com/2016/07/07/a-peek-into-torontos-abandoned-bay-lower-subway-station/). This unused platform is now used to host events, film videos, and many other things!

### The Rocket Network
*image of 86E bus*

Before the [Express Bus Network](https://stevemunro.ca/2018/07/25/ttc-launches-the-900-express-bus-network/) was established in 2018, which utilizes the 900 series bus routes, the express network included the "Rocket Network," with bus routes utilizing a form of 19X (where X is a integer from 0 to 9 - [ex// 198 UofT Scarborough Rocket](https://transittoronto.ca/bus/routes/198-uoft-scarbo.shtml)), and an E or Express variant of the local route such as the 86E, [116E*](#the-116e-express), 54E, 95E, etc.

### The Unique Toronto Gauge
The subways on Lines 1, 2, & 4 and streetcars all use the [unique Toronto gauge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto-gauge_railways) for their tracks.
