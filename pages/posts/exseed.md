Last weekend I traveled to Hamilton to attend a hackathon at McMaster University. Participating in the [2024 Google Developers Solutions Challenge](https://developers.google.com/community/gdsc-solution-challenge), my teammates and I decided to tackle the issue of life on land and the negative production externality of farming crops on the environment and soil health. exSeed is an app designed to help farmers make smart farming decisions to improve the environment and their own long-term financial health. 

Made with Google's Flutter product and programmed. Linked to Google Firebase for backend processing.

The food at this hackathon was amazing, it was lacking at the beginning, however on the final day there was bubble tea, pizza, and a lot of burritos. It was a lot of food and I genuinely felt full afterwards. Although we didn't win anything at the hackathon, the experience was fun as this was my first ever hackathon. I packed my laptop and everything, travelled to Hamilton from Waterloo, and slept at my friend's dorm on the couch. The couch was not very comfortable, I should've done what my friend did and brought a sleeping bag. 

Being in Hamilton for a weekend made me realize just how boring Hamilton is and the little things there are to do there (sorry my mac friends). While the campus is nice and spacious, everything feels so far away (constant UWP to REV typa trip). The only off-campus food plaza has one store that's open after midnight, with everything else closing well before that (and I thought everything in Waterloo closed early). And don't get me started on that intersection crosswalk. Jokes aside, the campus is nice with a super nice gym and the Peter George building I would say is better than Waterloo's Engineering 7 (E7) building. I got to see some of my IB high school friends again after half a year and re-connected with a long lost friend which was nice to catch up with.
