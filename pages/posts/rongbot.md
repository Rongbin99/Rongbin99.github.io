The RongBot™️ was a Discord bot that I developed during COVID when my high school classes were online. Being bored out of my mind, I decided to take the advice of my friend and followed a [Python Discord bot tutorial YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-7Dfw57ZZVRB4N7VWPjmT0Q-2FIMNBMP) that he linked to me. Before this project, I had basic to no programming experience in Python or any other language for that matter. I was challenged and learned a lot during this process. Afterwards, I learned how to use Python to interact with the Operating System, find files, and to read/write JSON files. I also learned how to use cogs to split my code across multiple Python files, and to import variables, functions, and tools from various libraries into my project files. I gained knowledge of Discord's Developer portal, API, and the multiple Python Discord libraries that are available. I had to use Python classes, and many runtime commands and URL requests. 

In the end, I learned a lot about creating an application in Python and using an external API and to read the documentation. The bot supports slash commands and has various functions. It has a VALORANT rank checker, that takes in the RIOT ID of the user as an input and returns an API request with the rank output into the Discord channel. It also has the ability to send and message users, along with the usual moderation commands such as kick and ban. The RongBot™️ also has a few easter eggs, a YouTube video notification ability (broke with new YouTube update), a crystal ball, and the ability to play audio in a voice channel (VC).
