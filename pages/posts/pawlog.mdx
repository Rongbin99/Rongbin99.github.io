Last month, I attended [DeltaHacks XI](https://www.deltahacks.com/) at McMaster University in Hamilton. For this hackathon, my group members and I decided to create an application that allows pet owners to easily track the pet caring tasks of their various pets. This tool would help them track the times fed, walked, and other pet needs. This tool is aimed towards households where the pet caring responsibilities are split amongst the household members, dedicated pet walkers, and pet centers such as shelters and vets where they would need to track a large amount of pets. 

It works by allowing the user to sign-in to the portal and add a profile for each pet. Each pet has a pet caring log where entries can be made for when the pet was fed, walked, etc. and this allows others to know that the pet has already been cared for for the day.

This website was created with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, and uses MongoDB and node.js for the backend. For the login system, we utilised Auth0 as it was a MLH hackathon sponsor.

Overall, this hackathon was a fun experience. I got to team up with some long time friends of mine that I haven't seen in over a decade (actually crazy) ever since primary school. There were many difficulties with setting up the node.js server and getting everyone on pace with Next.js and incorporating Auth0, but for a first hackathon project for my teammates, I'm proud of what we were able to accomplish in the span of 24 hours and the knowledge gained from it.
