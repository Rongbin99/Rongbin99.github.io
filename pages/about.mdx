## Quick Introduction

<div className="flex">
    Hi there! I'm Rongbin Gu (顾荣彬), a Computer Engineering student studying at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/electrical-computer-engineering/)! In my free time I like to go swimming, play badminton, rage at video games, sleep, and cook food. My interests lie in both hardware and software, with a passion for video games, game development, AI, media production and transportation. I am always looking to tackle new challenges and seek new opportunities.
    Here's a little more about my personal self.

## Personal Life and Hobbies
I am always looking for new opportunities to grow and learn from. Some of my hobbies include:
- Biking
- Badminton
- Video Games
- [Photography](/creative)
- [Public Transit](/posts/ttc)
- Swimming
- Skating
- [Anime](/posts/anime)

I am a part-time lifeguard and swim instructor; I also enjoy editing videos and watching esports in my free time. 

During the summer of 2023, my friend and I embarked on an adventure to bike from Scarborough to Niagara Falls and possibly across the US/Canada border into New York state. This was a grand total of 164+ KM. We departed at 4AM and reached downtown Toronto by 6AM. Eventually, we reached Niagara Falls late afternoon, took a quick Tim's break, and crossed the border. We returned just in time to catch the evening GO Train back to Toronto's Union station.

Summer 2024, I embarked on a 80KM bike ride with my friends to the Don Valley from Scarborough, marking the second time doing this — last time being summer 2022.
