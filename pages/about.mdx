## Quick Introduction

<div className="flex">
    Hi there! I'm Rongbin Gu (顾荣彬), a Computer Engineering student studying at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/electrical-computer-engineering/)! In my free time I like to go swimming, play badminton, rage at video games, sleep, and cook food. My interests lie in both hardware and software, with a passion for video games, game development, AI, media production and transportation. I am always looking to tackle new challenges and seek new opportunities.
    Here's a little more about my personal self.
