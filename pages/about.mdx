I am a part-time lifeguard and swim instructor, I also enjoy editing videos and watching esports in my free time. 

During the summer of 2023, my friend and I embarked on an adventure to bike from Scarborough to Niagara Falls and possibly across the US/Canada border into New York state. This was a grand total of 164+ KM. We departed at 4AM and reached downtown Toronto by 6AM. Eventually, we reached Niagara Falls late afternoon, took a quick Tim's break, and crossed the border. We returned just in time to catch the evening GO Train back to Toronto Union station.
